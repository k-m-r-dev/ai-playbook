# Work to Chores

**Plan only.** Interview, review, plan, validate, write `.w2c/` artifacts. Never implement product code.

Read `USAGE.md` in this folder for the plain-English invocation.

## Prerequisites (hard stop)

Before Stage 1:

1. Confirm **grilling** and **brainstorming** are invocable in this environment.
2. Confirm `.w2c/scripts/w2c.sh` (or `w2c.py`) exists in the current repo.

If grilling or brainstorming is missing: **STOP**. Log `--stage prereq --event stop --detail "missing grilling|brainstorming"`. Tell the user which skill is missing and ask them to add it. Do not invent a substitute interview.

If scripts are missing: **STOP**. Log `--stage prereq --event stop --detail "missing .w2c/scripts"`. Tell the user to run:

```bash
bash scripts/install-w2c-to-project.sh --repo .
```

(From the playbook repo that contains that script.) Then they re-invoke this skill.

If `.w2c/` ledger files are missing, run `.w2c/scripts/w2c.sh init`.

**Worktree skill (mode-dependent):** as soon as Isolation mode is chosen as `worktree` (Stage 3), confirm **using-git-worktrees** is invocable the same way other skills are checked. If missing: **STOP**. Log `--stage prereq --event stop --detail "missing using-git-worktrees"`. Tell the user to add the Superpowers using-git-worktrees skill. Do not invent a substitute worktree procedure. Re-check before Stage 5 handoff if mode is still `worktree`.

## Status writes

Use the CLI only for STATE.md, QUEUE.md, ROADMAP emojis, task checkboxes, DECISIONS rows, and new CONTEXT versions:

```bash
.w2c/scripts/w2c.sh status
.w2c/scripts/w2c.sh decide --scope ... --decision ... --choice ... --rationale ...
.w2c/scripts/w2c.sh context-new --minor   # or --major
.w2c/scripts/w2c.sh next-milestone-id
.w2c/scripts/w2c.sh milestone-new --slug ...
.w2c/scripts/w2c.sh milestone-status M001 PLANNING
```

Never hand-edit those status bits. Authoring plan content (vision, tasks, verify commands, Git Operation Plan) is allowed after Stage 5 approval.

## Events (local only)

Append-only JSONL at `.w2c/runtime/events.jsonl`. Gitignored. Never commit it. Never hand-edit it. The CLI is the only writer.

```bash
.w2c/scripts/w2c.sh event --skill work-to-chores --stage STAGE --event EVENT [--milestone M###] [--slice S##] [--task T##] [--detail "..."]
.w2c/scripts/w2c.sh events --tail 20 [--skill work-to-chores]
```

`--event` is one of: `started`, `complete`, `pass`, `fail`, `stop`, `retry`.

Log at every stage enter/exit and every hard stop. `decide`, `milestone-new`, `context-new`, and `milestone-status` also append automatically.

## Stage 1 - Gather context

Always run this stage, even when a ticket or spec is pasted.

Log `--stage gather --event started` before interviewing.

Need a hint of the work. If the prompt has no ticket, spec, or description: ask for one before interviewing.

Then, in order:

1. **Grilling** - one question at a time. Search the codebase before asking. Recommended option marked. Close when **scope, users, done criteria, risks, integrations, and out-of-scope** are clear. Log `--stage gather --event complete --detail grilling` when that pass closes (or `retry` if you must restart it).
2. **Brainstorming** - find structural gaps (edge cases, empty states, testing seams). Log `--stage gather --event complete --detail brainstorming` when it closes.
3. **Grilling again** - confirm each gap and pick a solution.

Log `--stage gather --event complete` when Stage 1 finishes.

Save knowledge with `w2c context-new` (first pass may use the `CONTEXTv1.0.md` from `init`; later loops always create a new file). Never overwrite an existing CONTEXT file.

Version bump: **major** if scope, users, or done-criteria change; **minor** for clarifications, risks, out-of-scope, wording.

Record major decisions with `w2c decide`.

## Stage 2 - Review context

Log `--stage review --event started`.

Review collected knowledge for architectural or design gaps that would break the original requirement.

If you find an issue, present in plain English:

- what is wrong
- impact
- multiple options
- a recommended option

Wait for a choice. Save it with `w2c decide`. Then return to Stage 1 with a new CONTEXT version. Log `--stage review --event retry` before looping.

If no issue: log `--stage review --event complete`.

## Stage 3 - Plan

Log `--stage plan --event started`.

Break work into milestones `M###` (unique; `w2c next-milestone-id` / `w2c milestone-new --slug`). Each milestone has slices `S01`, `S02`, ... and tasks `T01`, `T02`, ... fully specified with a Verify line.

Milestone states: PLANNING, TODO, PAUSED, INPROGRESS, DONE, ERROR, STOP.

Each task needs a testing or other verification plan. Embed this execution rule in every slice plan (do **not** execute it here):

- A task is not complete until Verify passes and **requesting-code-review** is clean. Loop fix, verify, review until both succeed. Write `S##-T##-SUMMARY.md`, then `w2c complete`.
- When every task in a slice is complete: re-run that slice’s Verify commands, write `S##-UAT.md` and `S##-SUMMARY.md`, then `w2c slice-complete`.
- When every slice in a milestone is complete: validate the whole milestone, write `M###-VALIDATION.md` and `M###-SUMMARY.md`, then `w2c milestone-complete`.

### Git isolation (required grilling — one question at a time)

During Stage 3, grill these decisions **before** the draft plan is marked ready. Only two modes exist: `worktree` or `branch` (no in-place).

1. **Isolation mode** — ask worktree vs branch. Plain English: worktree = separate directory via using-git-worktrees (recommended when that skill is available); branch = same checkout, switch/create the ticket branch. Save with `w2c decide`. If `worktree`, run the using-git-worktrees prereq check immediately.
2. **Branch name** — Local branch **must equal** Remote branch.
   - If an external ticket id exists (e.g. `MOR-252`): propose that exact id as the only remote/local branch name and confirm.
   - If no ticket: propose 2–3 slug options plus custom; confirm the exact string.
   - Save with `w2c decide`.

Isolation scope is always **ticket**: every milestone/slice for this ticket shares the same mode and branch. Setup happens on **first `do-chores`**, not during planning. Do **not** create a worktree in this skill.

Default guardrails in each `M###-ROADMAP.md` Delivery and Guardrails table:

- Isolation mode + Branch name filled from the grilled decisions
- commit cadence = milestone (one commit after the milestone is verified)
- no push/PR without explicit user approval
- no per-run git handshake

Every `M###-ROADMAP.md` and every `M###-S##-PLAN.md` must include a filled **`## Git Operation Plan`** table (see templates). Slice plans must mirror the same Isolation mode, Local branch, and Remote branch as the milestone — do not invent a different branch.

Required Git Operation Plan fields (milestone is canonical):

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Isolation mode | `worktree` or `branch` |
| Local branch | ticket id or confirmed slug |
| Remote branch | **must equal** Local branch |
| Isolation scope | `ticket` |
| Setup when | `first-do-chores` |
| Plan commit | `required-before-isolation` |
| Reuse policy | `reuse-if-same-ticket-else-stop` |
| Worktree skill | `using-git-worktrees` if mode is `worktree`; `n/a` if `branch` |
| Push rule | after milestone verification + explicit user approval; push ref must equal Remote branch |

Do not implement product code in this skill.

Log `--stage plan --event complete` when the draft plan is ready for validation.

## Stage 4 - Validate the plan

Log `--stage validate --event started`. Until there are no pending issues or gaps, loop Stages 1-4. Never rewrite an existing CONTEXT; `w2c context-new --major` or `--minor`. Save decisions with `w2c decide`. Log `--stage validate --event retry` on each loop back, then `--stage validate --event complete` when clean.

Confirm Git Operation Plan is present and consistent across all milestones/slices for the ticket (same mode and branch).

## Stage 5 - User review

Log `--stage user-review --event started`. Ask the user to review the plan (including isolation mode and branch name). If they request a change:

1. Do not trust it until checked against the original requirement.
2. If it fits: restate what you understood and your suggested adjustment; wait for confirmation; then Stage 1 with a new CONTEXT version. Log `--stage user-review --event retry`.
3. If it does not fit: explain the mismatch; do not change the plan. Log `--stage user-review --event fail --detail mismatch`.

When they approve: log `--stage user-review --event complete`.

## Write the plan (after approval only)

Log `--stage write --event started` before creating or filling milestone files.

Canonical tree:

```text
.w2c/
  plans/M###-<slug>/
    M###-ROADMAP.md
    M###-CONTEXT.md
    M###-S##-PLAN.md
    S##-T##-SUMMARY.md
    S##-UAT.md
    S##-SUMMARY.md
    M###-VALIDATION.md
    M###-SUMMARY.md
  contexts/CONTEXTvX.Y.md
  DECISIONS.md
  ROADMAP.md
  STATE.md
  QUEUE.md
```

Use `w2c milestone-new` then fill ROADMAP/CONTEXT/slice plan content (including Git Operation Plan). Formats: follow the templates in `shared/w2c/templates/` and `shared/w2c/README.md`. Milestone files are `M###-ROADMAP.md` + `M###-CONTEXT.md` + slice plans - never a second `M###-PLAN.md`.

`w2c milestone-status` / `w2c set` for pointers. `w2c smoke` before handing off to do-chores — smoke **fails** if Git Operation Plan is missing, Isolation mode is not `worktree`/`branch`, Local≠Remote, branch is empty/`N/A`, or worktree mode lacks `using-git-worktrees` in Worktree skill. Log `--stage write --event complete` when smoke is clean.

### Plan-commit gate (required before handoff)

After smoke PASS, ask for explicit approval to put plan artifacts on the ticket branch so first `do-chores` isolation can see `.w2c/`:

1. If the local branch named Remote branch does not exist: create it from current HEAD only when the working tree is clean **or** dirty only with the new `.w2c/` plan/ledger files. Otherwise **STOP** and ask.
2. Check out that branch under the same clean/dirty rules. Never force-checkout, force-reset, or delete branches/worktrees.
3. Commit **only** `.w2c/` plan and ledger files (plans, STATE/QUEUE/ROADMAP/DECISIONS/contexts as needed). Never product code. Never `.w2c/runtime/`.
4. **Do not push.**

Log `--stage plan-commit --event complete` (or `stop` / `fail`) with the branch name in `--detail`.

Then tell the user: run `do-chores` next; isolation setup (worktree create or branch ensure) happens on the first execution unit.

## Red flags - STOP

- Implementing product code
- Skipping grilling or brainstorming
- Overwriting CONTEXTvX.Y.md
- Hand-editing STATE/QUEUE/checkboxes/ROADMAP emojis
- Writing milestone files before Stage 5 approval
- Reusing a milestone id
- Committing `.w2c/runtime/` or hand-editing `events.jsonl`
- Skipping branch confirmation or writing `N/A` / unequal Local vs Remote branch
- Creating a worktree during planning (setup is first `do-chores` only)
- Pushing or opening a PR from this skill
- Inventing a worktree procedure when using-git-worktrees is missing
