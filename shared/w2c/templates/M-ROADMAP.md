### Guardrails
- **Commit cadence** — one commit after the milestone is verified unless this table says otherwise. Do not commit per slice by default.
- **Remote mutation** — no push, PR, or remote git mutation without explicit user approval.
- **Git isolation** — honor Isolation mode (`worktree` or `branch` only). Local branch must equal Remote branch (ticket id or confirmed slug). Setup on first `do-chores`; reuse the same ticket isolation across milestones.
- **Plan commit** — commit `.w2c/` plan/ledger files (never `runtime/`, never product code) onto the ticket branch before isolation so a worktree can see the ledger. No push without approval.
- **No force git** — never force-reset, force-push, or delete worktrees/branches. Dirty or unexpected existing branch/worktree → hard stop and ask.
- **Validation** — run the validation commands in this table before each commit and before each push.
- **Status writes** — never hand-edit STATE.md, QUEUE.md, ROADMAP status emojis, or task checkboxes. Use `.w2c/scripts/w2c.sh`.
- **Verify loop** — a task is not complete until its Verify commands pass and requesting-code-review is clean.
- **Closeout reports** — write `S##-T##-SUMMARY.md` before `complete`; `S##-UAT.md` + `S##-SUMMARY.md` before `slice-complete`; `M###-VALIDATION.md` + `M###-SUMMARY.md` before milestone DONE.
